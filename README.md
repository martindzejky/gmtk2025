# Lasso Sheriff

As the legendary Lasso Sheriff, you must defeat bandits using just your trusty lasso.

This is a **GMTK game jam 2025 submission**. [Play the game at Itch](https://martindzejky.itch.io/lasso-sheriff) in your browser or alternatively download it for Windows or Mac [in the Releases](https://github.com/martindzejky/lasso-sheriff/releases) here on GitHub.

## How to play

Use `WSAD` keys to move. Use `shift` to **dash** around the enemies. Use your mouse to aim and the `left mouse button` to throw your lasso.

Since I did not have enough time to make a proper in-game tutorial, here is a short version:

1. Throw your lasso to hook an enemy
2. Loop around them to capture them
3. You can capture multiple enemies at once!
